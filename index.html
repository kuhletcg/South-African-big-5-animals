    <h1>Big five animals</h1>

    <h2>Elephant</h2>
    <p>Elephant, (family Elephantidae), largest living land animal, characterized by its 
        long trunk (elongated upper lip and nose), columnar legs, and huge head with
         temporal glands and wide, flat ears. Elephants are grayish to brown in colour, 
         and their body hair is sparse and coarse. They are found most often in savannas,
          grasslands, and forests but occupy a wide range of habitats, including deserts,
           swamps, and highlands in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>

    <h2>Lion</h2>
    <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, 
        teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold,
         and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown
          to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, 
          genetics and hormones.<br></br> Young lions have light spotting on their coats that
           disappears as they grow.Without their coats, lion and tiger bodies are so similar 
           that only experts can tell
 them apart.
 
 Lions primarily eat large animals that weigh from 100 to 1,000 pounds (45 to 453 
 kilograms), such as zebra and wildebeest. In times of shortage, they also catch and eat a 
 variety of smaller animals, from rodents to reptiles.<br></br> Lions also steal kills from hyenas, leopards
  and other predators. At times, they may lose their own catches to hyena groups. Lions may also 
  feed on domestic livestock, especially in areas near villages.</p>

    <h2>Buffalo</h2>
    <p>Buffalo are large members of the Bovidae family. There are two types of buffalo: the 
        African or Cape buffalo and the Asian water buffalo. They are dark gray or black 
        animals that look a lot like bulls.

Buffalo are often confused with bison. Early American settlers called bison "buffalo" because
 the animals are similar in appearance.<br></br>
Buffalo are herbivores, and so eat only vegetation. Their favorite foods are grass and herbs,
 but water buffalo will also eat aquatic plants. Both African and Asian buffalo will eat 
 shrubs and trees when they can't find grass or herbs to eat.</p>

    <h2>Leapard</h2>
    <p>The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, 
        a member of the Felidae.[4] It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in
         small parts of Western and Central Asia, on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and
          East Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard
           populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining 
           in large parts of the global range. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuwait, Syria, Libya,
            Tunisia and most likely in Morocco, leopard populations have already been extirpated.
            Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical 
            global range.<br></br>

Leopards are hunted illegally, and their body parts are smuggled in the wildlife trade for
 medicinal practices and decoration.

Compared to other wild cats, the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with
 a large skull. Its fur is marked with rosettes. It is similar in appearance to the jaguar, 
 but has a smaller, lighter physique, and its rosettes are generally smaller, more densely
  packed and without central spots. </p>

    <h2>Rhino</h>
    <p>Rhinoceroses are large, herbivorous mammals identified by their characteristic
         horned snouts. The word "rhinoceros" comes from the Greek "rhino" (nose) and 
         "ceros" (horn). There are five species and 11 subspecies of rhino; some have 
         two horns, while others have one.</p>
